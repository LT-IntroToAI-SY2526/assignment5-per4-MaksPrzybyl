# Assignment 5 Write up

Assignment 5 can be broken up into the following parts:
1. Import the Necessary Modules:
- `copy`: For creating deep copies of objects
- `Stack` and `Queue`: Custom implementations for DFS and BFS operations
2. Utility Functions: 
- `remove_if_exists`: Removes a specified element from a list if it exists, which is used to remove the possibilites from a cell
3. Board Class:
- Represents the Sudoku board
- Consists of functions that will find the most constrained cell, and update the board, which eliminates possible solutions
4. DFS & BFS Functions:
- `DFS`: Uses depth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It works by trying to fill the most constrained cell with potential values until a solution is found or backtracks if a mistake is made
- `BFS`: Uses breadth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle in a similar fashion to DFS but explores nodes level by level
5. Main Execution:
- Defines two different sets of initial moves for Sudoku puzzles
- Uses both DFS and BFS to solve each puzzle and prints the results


After completing the assignment, answer the following reflection questions:

## Reflection Questions

1. What are some things that you learned through this assignment? Think about the concepts of backtracking, constraint satisfaction, and search algorithms. Were there any particular challenges you faced while implementing the Board class methods or the DFS/BFS functions? How did you overcome them?
I learned how backtracking works because the program has to undo wrong moves and try new ones, which was kind of confusing at first. The hardest part was getting the board to update correctly, but I fixed it by printing a lot of test outputs and slowly checking where things went wrong.


2. How can you apply what you learned in this assignment to future programs or projects? Consider other types of problems that involve searching through possibilities, making decisions, and backtracking when those decisions don't work out. Can you think of real-world scenarios where DFS or BFS might be useful? What about other constraint satisfaction problems?
I can use these ideas in other projects where I need to try different possibilities, like pathfinding or solving logic puzzles. DFS and BFS seem useful for real-world things like finding routes on maps or searching through files on a computer.


3. Explain how the Stack and Queue classes work and why they are important for DFS and BFS algorithms. Describe the difference between LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out) data structures. How does using a Stack versus a Queue change the way the search algorithm explores possible solutions? Why is one data structure better suited for depth-first search and the other for breadth-first search?
The Stack and Queue classes matter because DFS uses a stack (LIFO) and BFS uses a queue (FIFO), and that changes how the search explores the puzzle. A stack goes deep right away, while a queue checks things level by level, which is why each one fits its specific search algorithm better.
